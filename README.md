# identifiers.org stanza widgets

This was generated by TogoStanza, which enables the development of reusable web components which are embeddable into any web page.
Widgets created with it are called stanzas.

Three stanzas are available:
- A portable version of our resolution search bar, as shown on our front page,
- A button for converting URLs into identifiers.org URIs and copying them into the user's clipboard,
- A verifier that displays different icons according to the validity of a CURIE.
